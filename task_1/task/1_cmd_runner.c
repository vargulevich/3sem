/*
  Write a program which allow you to: 
- run another programs via command line.
- get exit codes of terminated programs

## TIPS:
1. Use "2_fork_wait_exit.c" and "4_exec_dir.c" from examples. Combine them.
2. Parse input string according to the type of exec* (see "man exec").
   a) if execvp is used, string splitting into "path" and "args" is all you need.
3. Collect exit codes via waitpid/WEXITSTATUS.
